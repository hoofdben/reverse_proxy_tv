Reverse Proxy TV — Documentation

This folder will hold all documentation going forward.

Planned documents:
- ARCHITECTURE.md — high-level overview and component diagram
- SECURITY.md — authentication, JWT, encryption of Xtream credentials
- API.md — endpoints and request/response examples
- DEPLOYMENT.md — Portainer + Traefik + secrets setup
- OPERATIONS.md — health, logs, backups, monitoring
- CONFIG.md — application.yml and environment variables
- CHANGELOG.md — changes by release

For now, see ARCHITECTURE.md and DEPLOYMENT.md for the initial setup notes.
